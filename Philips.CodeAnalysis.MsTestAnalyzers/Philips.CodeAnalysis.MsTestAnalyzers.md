| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [PH2000](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2000.md)  | Avoid test method  prefix                            | Test Method names must not start with 'Test', 'Ensure', or 'Verify'. Otherwise, they are more difficult to find in sorted lists in Test Explorer. |
| [PH2003](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2003.md)  | Assert.AreEqual usage                                | Assert.AreEqual/AreNotEqual should be of the form AreEqual(&lt;Expected Non-Null Literal&gt;, &lt;Actual Expression&gt;) |
| [PH2004](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2004.md)  | Avoid ExpectedException attribute                    | The [ExpectedException()] attribute does not have line number granularity.  It also trips the debugger.  Use Assert.Throws() instead. |
| [PH2005](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2005.md)  | TestContext usage                                    | TestContext should be used or removed.                       |
| [PH2008](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2008.md)  | Assert.AreEqual parameter types must match           | The types of the parameters of Are[Not]Equal must match.  The AssertNotEqual pattern is particularly insidious, as the Assert may pass because they types unknowingly differ, even though the values are the same. |
| [PH2009](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2009.md)  | Assert.IsTrue/IsFalse Usage                          | Do not call IsTrue/IsFalse if AreEqual/AreNotEqual will suffice.  E.g., avoid Assert.IsTrue(x ==5).  Use AreEqual(5, x) instead for clearer error messages. |
| [PH2010](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2010.md)  | Assert.IsTrue/IsFalse Usage                          | Avoid unnecessary parantheses around &lt;expected&gt; and &lt;actual&gt; |
| [PH2011](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2011.md)  | Description Attribute usage                          | Description works awkwardly with Test Explorer. Avoid literal strings and keep them short. |
| [PH2012](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2012.md)  | TestTimeout required                                 | Every unit test must have a test timeout to help prevent CI/CD bloat.  Consider something such as the following to exempt active debugging and to give the CI/CD pipeline a small buffer:<br /><span style="font-family:'Courier New', monospace">// Uncomment to run tests locally in a debugger.<br>//#define DEBUGGING_TESTS<br>     public sealed class TestTimeouts 	{<br> #if DEBUGGING_TESTS<br> 		public const bool IsDebuggingTests = true;<br> 		public const int Ci = int.MaxValue;<br> 		public const int Integration = int.MaxValue;<br> 		public const int Smoke = int.MaxValue;<br> #else<br> 		public const bool IsDebuggingTests = false;<br>   #if BUILDSERVER<br> 		public const int Ci = 1000;<br> #else<br> 		public const int Ci = 200;<br>#endif<br> 		public const int Integration = Durations.TenSecondsInMilliseconds;<br> public const int Smoke = Durations.FifteenMinutesInMilliseconds;</span><br> #endif |
| [PH2013](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2013.md)  | Avoid Ignore attribute                               | Tests marked as Ignore are dead code.                        |
| [PH2014](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2014.md)  | Avoid Owner attribute                                | Experience showed that this attribute's contents languished.  This could be enhanced to mimic PH2011. |
| [PH2015](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2015.md)  | Allowed Categories attribute                         | Tests must have a category, and the allowed category must match options specified in the .editorconfig.  E.g., `dotnet_code_quality.PH2015.allowed_test_categories=Unit,Integration`<br />Whitelisted tests are supported.  E.g., perhaps you have 100 legacy `Nightly` tests.  They run too slowly to be `Unit` tests.  You do not want to delete them; however, you do not want any more created.  Create a file named `TestsWithUnsupportedCategory.Allowed.txt`in the project.  Mark the file as an AdditionalInclude such that the Analyzer can see it.  Specify one TestMethod name per line. |
| [PH2016](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2016.md)  | Avoid TestInitialize attribute                       | This attribute is unnecessary in the C# programming language. They circumvent TestTimeouts, allowing for slower Test Runs.  They can contribute to non-deterministic test execution order, resulting complications while debugging. |
| [PH2017](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2017.md)  | Avoid ClassInitialize attribute                      | This attribute is unnecessary in the C# programming language. They circumvent TestTimeouts, allowing for slower Test Runs.  They can contribute to non-deterministic test execution order, resulting complications while debugging. |
| [PH2018](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2018.md)  | Avoid ClassCleanup attribute                         | This attribute is unnecessary in the C# programming language. They circumvent TestTimeouts, allowing for slower Test Runs.  They can contribute to non-deterministic test execution order, resulting complications while debugging. |
| [PH2019](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2019.md)  | Avoid TestCleanup attribute                          | This attribute is unnecessary in the C# programming language. They circumvent TestTimeouts, allowing for slower Test Runs.  They can contribute to non-deterministic test execution order, resulting complications while debugging. |
| [PH2033](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2033.md)  | DataTestMethod requires DataRows                     | DataTestMethods must have at least 1 DataRow.  TestMethods must not have any DataRows. |
| [PH2034](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2034.md)  | TestMethod requires TestClass                        | TestMethods not inside a TestClass are not executed.  They are dead code. |
| [PH2035](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2035.md)  | DataTestMethod requires correct parameter count      | DataTestMethods must have the same number of parameters of the DataRows, TestMethods should have no arguments. |
| [PH2036](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2036.md)  | TestMethod is public                                 | TestMethods must be public.                                  |
| [PH2037](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2037.md)  | TestMethods and DataTestMethods require unique names | TestMethods and DataTestMethods require unique names.        |
| [PH2038](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2038.md)  | TestClass is public                                  | TestClass must be public.                                    |
| [PH2041](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2041.md)  | Avoid MS Fakes                                       | Do not use MS Fakes as a Dependency Injection solution. Use Moq instead for example. |
| [PH2050](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2050.md)  | Avoid empty TestMethod                               | TestMethods must not be empty.                               |
| [PH2055](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2055.md)  | Avoid Assert.IsTrue(true)                            | Do not call IsTrue/IsFalse with a literal true/false.        |
| [PH2056](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2056.md)  | Avoid Assert.AreEqual(true, true)                    | Do not call AreEqual with a literal true/false.              |
| [PH2058](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2058.md)  | Avoid Assert conditional check                       | Do not use an inline null check while asserting. Use a different Assert.IsNotNull check. Assert.AreEqual(&lt;actual>?.attribute, &lt;expected>) => Assert.IsNotNull(&lt;actual>); Assert.AreEqual(&lt;actual>.attribute, &lt;expected>) |
| [PH2059](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2059.md)  | Public Method should be TestMethod                   | Public methods inside a TestClass should either be a test method or non-public. |
| [PH2076](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2076.md)  | Assert.Fail alternatives                             | Assert.Fail should not be used if an alternative is more appropriate |
| [PH2095](../Documentation/Diagnostics/PH2095.md)  | TestMethods must return void/Task for async methods  | TestMethods must return Task if they are async methods, or void if not |
