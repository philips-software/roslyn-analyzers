## Introduction

Make sure the let every occurence of an exception known to the people that support and service your code. This is mostly done by adding a antry to the Log of the application.

## How to solve

Whenever an exception is caught, an en entry to the Logfile by calling one of you Log methods.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
class BadExample
{
    public void BadMethod()
    {
        try
        {
            // Some code
        }
        catch (Exception) 
        {
            // Do nothing here
        }
    }
}

```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
class GoodExample
{
    public void GoodMethod()
    {
        try
        {
            // Some code
        }
        catch (Exception ex) 
        {
            LogException(ex, "Because of ...");
        }
    }
}

```

## Configuration

The Log method names are configurable in the .editorconfig using key: `dotnet_code_quality.PH2090.log_method_names` or by adding an named AllowedLogMethods.txt.

The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
