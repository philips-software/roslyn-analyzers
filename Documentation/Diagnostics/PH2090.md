## Introduction

Make sure the let every occurrence of an exception known to the people that support and service your code. This is mostly done by adding an entry to the Log of the application.

## How to solve

Whenever an exception is caught, and an entry to the Logfile by calling one of your Log methods.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
class BadExample
{
    public void BadMethod()
    {
        try
        {
            // Some code
        }
        catch (Exception) 
        {
            // Do nothing here
        }
    }
}

```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
class GoodExample
{
    public void GoodMethod()
    {
        try
        {
            // Some code
        }
        catch (Exception ex) 
        {
            LogException(ex, "Because of ...");
        }
    }
}

```

## Configuration

The Log method names are configurable in the .editorconfig using key: `dotnet_code_quality.PH2090.log_method_names` or by adding a named AllowedLogMethods.txt.

The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
