## Introduction

The evaluation times of a Regular Expression (using the `Regex` class) can be longer depending on its input. This is because of [backtracking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/backtracking-in-regular-expressions). 

Regular expression evaluation times are dependant on the input format and length, malicious input can make these evaluation times so long that the system does not respond anymore, resulting in a [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) attack.

## How to solve

When constructing a new `Regex` instance, provide a timeout as this limits the evaluation time.

.NET 7+ give an alternative solution in the `RegexOptions.NonBacktracking` option, which as the name suggests disables backtracking and therefore making the evaluation times linear with the input length.

## Example

Code that triggers 2 diagnostics:
``` cs
class BadExample {
  public void BadCode() {
    Regex regex = new Regex(".*");
  }
}
```

And the corrected code:
``` cs
class GoodExample {
  public void GoodCode() {
    Regex regex = new Regex(".*", RegexOptions.Compiled, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
  }
}
```

And the corrected code in .NET 7+:
``` cs
class GoodExample {
  public void GoodCode() {
    Regex regex = new Regex(".*", RegexOptions.NonBacktracking);
  }
}
```

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
