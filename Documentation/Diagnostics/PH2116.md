## Introduction

The `ArrayList` should be avoided. It doesn't use generics and therefore suffers from performance issues when used with structs. Structs need to be [boxed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/boxing-and-unboxing) into a class on every call to `ArrayList`, which impacts the performance negatively.

Microsoft discourages the use of `ArrayList` for this reason, as can be read on [MS Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.arraylist?view=net-7.0#remarks).

## How to solve

Microsoft provides an alternative in the `List<>` class, which is supporting generics and doesn't suffer from the boxing issue. Otherwise `List<>` is equivalent in usage to `ArrayList`. In this sense, it can be regarded as a plug-in replacement.

The CodeFixer does the replacement of `ArrayList` with `List<>` for you. The generic type cannot be deduced however so the CodeFixer triggers a rename dialog for the user to specify this generic type.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
using System.Collections;
class BadExample 
{
    private ArrayList _list = new ArrayList();

    public void Add(int item) 
    {
        _list.Add(item);
    }
}

```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
using System.Collections.Generic;
class GoodExample 
{
    private List<int> _list = new List<int>();

    public void Add(int item) 
    {
        _list.Add(item);
    }
}

```

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
