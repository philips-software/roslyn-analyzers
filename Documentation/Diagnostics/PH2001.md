## Introduction

This analyzer checks if the text of the XML code documentation has content. Without content, it's not adding value. 

## How to solve

If the purpose of the related code is obvious, remove the XML comments. This is what the CodeFixer does. If the code would benefit from documentation, provide it.

Note: Creating useful comments for every member can be a large effort and if you named your members correctly, their name specifies the purpose already. In these cases XML documentation might not add anything. This viewpoint can cause interference with [CS1591](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs1591), consider disabling it.

## Example

Code that triggers 2 diagnostics:
``` cs
	/// <summary>
	///
	/// </summary>
	[Flags]
	public enum LogFilters
	{
		/// <summary>
		/// 
		/// </summary>
		None = 0x00,
		/// <summary>
		/// Indicates that verbose entries should be logged.
		/// </summary>
		Verbose = 0x01,
		Information = 0x02,
		Warning = 0x04,
		Error = 0x08,
		Default = Information | Error | Warning,
		All = Information | Error | Warning | Verbose
	}

```

And the corrected code:
``` cs
	[Flags]
	public enum LogFilters
	{
		/// <summary>
		/// If used in isolation, indicates that entries should not be logged.
		/// </summary>
		None = 0x00,
		/// <summary>
		/// Indicates that verbose entries should be logged.
		/// </summary>
		Verbose = 0x01,
		Information = 0x02,
		Warning = 0x04,
		Error = 0x08,
		Default = Information | Error | Warning,
		All = Information | Error | Warning | Verbose
	}

```

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
