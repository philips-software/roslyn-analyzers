## Introduction

In old versions of Visual Studio, the Description was displayed in Test Explorer. Long descriptions were awkward to work with in the test list. This analyzer enforces short or non-existent descriptions. Nowadays, the Description value does not pollute the Test Explorer list, and the attribute is no longer useful.

## How to solve

1. Remove the Description attribute. The Description value is no longer integrated into Test Explorer, rendering its usefulness moot. This is what the Code Fixer does.
2. Place the description in a `const` value and keep it less than 25 characters.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
        public const string LongDescription = "12345678901234567890123456";

        [TestMethod]
        [Description(LongDescription)]
        public void BadTestMethod1()
        {
            Assert.AreEqual(1, 1);
        }
        
        [TestMethod]
        [Description("123")]
        public void BadTestMethod2()
        {
            Assert.AreEqual(1, 1);
        }
```

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
