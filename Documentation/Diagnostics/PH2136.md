## Introduction

Avoid using the same string literal in more then one location. This opens up the opportunity to make mistakes, like typos.

## How to solve

Put a constant in a central location in the project and refer to this constant. Take the opportunity to name it appropriately, as this increases readability.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
class BadExample
{
    public void BadMethod()
    {
        string str1 = "some";
        string str2 = "some";
    }
}

```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
class GoodExample
{
    private const string SomeString = "Some";
    public Task GoodMethod()
    {
        string str1 = SomeString;
        string str2 = SomeString;
    }
}

```

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
