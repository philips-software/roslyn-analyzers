## Introduction

Name properties, fields and variables should be named using positive wording. People can handle double negations poorly, and by using positive wording these are prevented.

Avoid the following negative words:
* absent
* disable
* ignore
* missing

## How to solve

Rename the variable and use positive phrasing for it.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
class BadExample
{
    public bool IsHelpful()
    {
        get
        {
            bool ignoreComments;
            return !ignoreComments;
        }
    }
}

```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
class GoodExample
{
    public bool IsHelpful()
    {
        get
        {
            bool isHelpful;
            return isHelpful;
        }
    }
}

```

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
