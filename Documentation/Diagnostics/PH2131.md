## Introduction

Name the file after its containing class / struct / enum, with the extension `.cs`. 

## How to solve

Rename the file to match the containing type.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
class SomeOtherName;
```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
class NameOfFile;
```
## Exceptions

If multiple types are present in a file, the Analyzer takes the first one.

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
