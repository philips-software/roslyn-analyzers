## Introduction

Avoid writing regions with no code inside. Regions that contain only comments are considered empty, unless the comments contain copyright information.

## How to solve

Remove the empty region. If the region contains copyright information, it is not considered empty and no action is needed.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
class BadExample
{
    #region Put some stuff here later
    #endregion

    #region Just a comment
    // This is just a regular comment
    #endregion
}

```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
class GoodExample
{
    #region Public Interface

    public void GoodMethod()
    {
        return;
    }

    #endregion

    #region Copyright Information
    // Â© 2025 Koninklijke Philips N.V. All rights reserved.
    #endregion
}

```

Note: Regions containing copyright information (with copyright symbols or "Copyright" keyword and a year) are not considered empty.

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
