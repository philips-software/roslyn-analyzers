## Introduction

Interfaces marked with `[ServiceContract]` must have methods marked with `[OperationContract]`

## How to solve

Usually this is just an ommission, add it.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
[ServiceContract]
class BadContract
{
    public void BadMethod(int number)
}

```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
[ServiceContract]
class GoodContract
{
    [OperationContract]
    public void GoodMethod(int number)
}

```

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
