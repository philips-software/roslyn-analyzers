## Introduction

Protected fields are accessible to derived classes and cen be changed by them without notice. This can invalidate the internal state of your class.

## How to solve

Replace the field by a property and make its setter `private`.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
class BadClass
{
    protected int _counter;
}

```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
class GoodClass
{
    protected int Count { get; private set; }
}

```

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
