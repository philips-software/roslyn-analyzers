## Introduction

Limit the number of logical expressions in a single condition. Humans are not very good at keeping track of large logical expressions. 

## How to solve

Split the condition up into multiple blocks and assign each of the blocks to a descriptively named boolean variable. The final condition is then a much smaller set of well named variables combined.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
class BadExample
{
    public void BadMethod()
    {
        if (3 == 4 && 5 == 6 || (7 == 9 && 8 == 1))
        {
            // Some code
        }
    }
}

```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
class GoodExample
{
    public void GoodMethod()
    {
        bool isInLowerRange = 3 == 4 && 5 == 6;
        bool isInHigherRange = 7 == 9 && 8 == 1;
        if (isInLowerRange || isInHigherRange)
        {
            // Some code
        }
    }
}

```

## Configuration

The maximum allowed number is configurable in the .editorconfig using key: `dotnet_code_quality.PH2092.max_operators`. The default is 4 operators.

The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
