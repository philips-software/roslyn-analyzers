## Introduction

This rule identifies packages with unacceptable licenses that may pose compliance risks to your project.

> **⚠️ Important Disclaimer**: This analyzer is designed to shift-left the developer experience when adding new NuGet packages and should not be construed as a replacement for commercial products devoted to license compliance. Do not rely on this analyzer as a source of truth for license compliance decisions. The author is neither accountable nor responsible for any mistakes or omissions in license detection. This analyzer only examines NuGet package references and does not cover other ways to reference third-party modules such as direct assembly references, COM references, or other dependency mechanisms.

## Reason

Packages with unacceptable licenses, particularly copyleft licenses like GPL, can impose legal obligations on your project. These licenses may require you to open-source your entire project or comply with specific distribution terms. It's important to review and approve such dependencies before including them in your codebase.

## How to fix violations

1. **Review the package license**: Examine whether the license is truly incompatible with your project's requirements
2. **Find alternatives**: Look for packages with more permissive licenses (MIT, BSD, Apache-2.0)
3. **Add to allowed list**: If the license is acceptable for your use case, add it to the `Allowed.Licenses.txt` configuration file
4. **Remove the package**: If no suitable alternative exists and the license is unacceptable, remove the package dependency

## Examples

### Package with unacceptable license

```xml
<!-- This package reference might trigger PH2155 if it has a GPL license -->
<PackageReference Include="SomeGplPackage" Version="1.0.0" />
```

### Diagnostic message

```
Package 'SomeGplPackage' version '1.0.0' has an unacceptable license 'GPL-3.0'. Consider adding to Allowed.Licenses.txt if license is acceptable.
```

### Resolution options

#### Option 1: Add to allowed licenses file

```xml
<!-- In your project file -->
<ItemGroup>
  <AdditionalFiles Include="Allowed.Licenses.txt" />
</ItemGroup>
```

```text
# Allowed.Licenses.txt - Add acceptable licenses to this file
# Commercial license for specific vendor
CommercialLicense-Vendor-X
# Allow GPL for this specific use case
GPL-3.0
```

#### Option 2: Find alternative package

Replace the package with one that has a more permissive license:

```xml
<!-- Replace with alternative package -->
<PackageReference Include="AlternativePackage" Version="2.0.0" />
```

#### Option 3: Remove the dependency

If the package is not essential, remove it entirely:

```xml
<!-- Remove the problematic dependency -->
<!-- <PackageReference Include="SomeGplPackage" Version="1.0.0" /> -->
```

## How the Analyzer Works

The LicenseAnalyzer implements an offline package license checking system that analyzes your project's NuGet dependencies without requiring network access:

### Architecture

1. **Project Discovery**: Searches source file paths to locate your project's `project.assets.json` file (avoids using external dependencies for .NET Standard 2.0 compatibility)
2. **Package Analysis**: Parses the lock file using custom JSON parsing to extract all PackageReference dependencies  
3. **License Extraction**: Examines the local NuGet global packages cache to read `.nuspec` files and extract license information
4. **Performance Caching**: Builds and maintains a `licenses.cache` file in the temporary obj folder alongside `project.assets.json` to cache license information and avoid repeated file system operations
5. **Offline Operation**: Works entirely offline using your local NuGet cache without requiring network calls

### License Detection

The analyzer can detect licenses from multiple sources:
- **SPDX expressions**: Reads modern `<license type="expression">` elements from .nuspec files
- **License URLs**: Parses older `<licenseUrl>` elements and extracts license types from common URL patterns
- **Fallback identification**: Recognizes common licenses like MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, GPL, LGPL from URLs

### Default Acceptable Licenses

The analyzer includes these permissive licenses as acceptable by default:
- MIT
- Apache-2.0  
- BSD-2-Clause
- BSD-3-Clause
- ISC
- Unlicense
- 0BSD
- github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT
- github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT
- go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=329770
- aka.ms/deprecateLicenseUrl
- www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/licence.html

## Configuration

This analyzer is **disabled by default**. You can enable it in your project file or through analyzer configuration:

```xml
<!-- Enable the analyzer -->
<PropertyGroup>
  <WarningsAsErrors />
  <WarningsNotAsErrors />
  <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>
</PropertyGroup>

<ItemGroup>
  <Analyzer Include="Philips.CodeAnalysis.SecurityAnalyzers" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Or enable it via .editorconfig:

```ini
# Enable PH2155 analyzer
dotnet_diagnostic.PH2155.severity = error
```

Configure allowed licenses by creating an `Allowed.Licenses.txt` file in your project and adding it as an additional file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <AdditionalFiles Include="Allowed.Licenses.txt" />
</ItemGroup>
```

The `Allowed.Licenses.txt` file supports:
- One license identifier per line
- Comments using `#` at the beginning of lines
- Custom license names for commercial or proprietary packages
- SPDX license identifiers

### Debug Logging Configuration

The analyzer provides detailed diagnostic logging to help troubleshoot issues with project.assets.json file discovery and license analysis. This is especially useful during development and deployment.

You can control debug logging via `.editorconfig`:

```ini
# Enable debug logging (default: enabled for now since analyzer is not production ready)
dotnet_code_quality.PH2155.enable_debug_logging = true

# Disable debug logging for production use
dotnet_code_quality.PH2155.enable_debug_logging = false
```

When enabled, the analyzer reports informational diagnostics about:
- Project.assets.json file search paths and results
- Source directory discovery from compilation
- File system operations and any exceptions
- Cache operations and license extraction results
- Configuration status and search completion

**Note**: Debug logging is currently enabled by default since this analyzer is disabled by default. When you enable the analyzer, you may want to disable debug logging for production use.

## Performance

The analyzer includes several performance optimizations:

### License Caching
- Creates a `licenses.cache` file in your project directory to cache license information
- Avoids repeated parsing of `.nuspec` files for the same packages
- Cache persists across builds for improved performance

### Offline Operation
- No network calls required - works entirely with local NuGet cache
- Leverages the existing `~/.nuget/packages` global packages folder
- Uses `project.assets.json` for accurate dependency information

### Graceful Degradation
- Handles missing dependencies (like NuGet.ProjectModel) gracefully in analyzer environments
- Skips analysis if `project.assets.json` cannot be located
- Continues operation even if individual package licenses cannot be determined

## Limitations

- Requires `project.assets.json` to be present (generated after `dotnet restore`)
- Depends on packages being available in the local NuGet global packages cache
- Some license detection relies on parsing `.nuspec` files and may not catch all license formats
- Currently disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled
