# PH2083: Avoid Pass By Reference

| Property | Value  |
|--|--|
| Package | [Philips.CodeAnalysis.MaintainabilityAnalyzers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Philips.CodeAnalysis.MaintainabilityAnalyzers) |
| Diagnostic ID | PH2083 |
| Category  | [Naming](../Naming.md) |
| Analyzer | [PassByRefAnalyzer](https://github.com/philips-software/roslyn-analyzers/blob/main/Philips.CodeAnalysis.MaintainabilityAnalyzers/Naming/PassByRefAnalyzer.cs)
| CodeFix  | No |
| Severity | Error |
| Enabled By Default | Yes |

## Introduction

Parameters that are passed by reference should be written to.

## How to solve

Pass by value, by removing the `ref` keyword.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
class BadExample
{
    public int BadMethod(ref int i)
    {
        int j = i;
        // Do stuff with j
        return j;
    }
}

```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
class GoodExample
{
    private readonly object _syncRoot;
    public int GoodMethod(int i)
    {
        int j = i;
        // Do stuff with j
        return j;
    }
}

```

## Exceptions

The following types of methods are exempt from this rule:
* Methods on interfaces
* Methods on abstract base classes
* Methods that are decorated with `[DllImport]`

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
