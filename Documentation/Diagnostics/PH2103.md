## Introduction

When invoking a method, its arguments should itself not be method invocations. These nested method calls can get confusing and are hard to read and debug.

## How to solve

Create a local variable and assign the result of the inner method invocation to it. Call the out method with that local variable. There is an CodeFixer available that does this for you. As a user, you are prompted for the name of the local variable.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
class BadExample
{
    public void BadMethod()
    {
        OtherMethod(GetRandomNumber());
    }
}

```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
class GoodExample
{
    public void GoodMethod() 
    {
        var randomNumber = GetRandomNumber();
        OtherMethod(randomNumber);
    }
}

```

## Exceptions

The following types of arguments are exempt from this rule:
* Invocations of ToString()
* Invocations within constructor initializers (i.e., `this` and `base`)
* Invocations to static methods (e.g., `Times.Once`, `Marshal.SizeOf`, `Mock.Of`, etc.)
* Inner invocations of nested invocations
* `nameof` expression
* Operators such as `sizeof` and `new`
* Arguments of Assert()
* Instantiations (i.e., `new`)

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
