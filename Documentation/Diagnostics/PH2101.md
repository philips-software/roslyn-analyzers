## Introduction

When you cast an object you should be clear as of your intentions. The regular cast will throw on `InvalidCastException` if the object is not of the type that you cast to. Using the `as` keyword does not throw this exception, but instead has the behavior that the resulting value can be null. This condition should be checked in your code, otherwise a `NullReferenceException` will be thrown.

## How to solve

When using the `as` keyword to cast on object, include a `null` check of the resulting variable.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
class BadExample {
  public int GetStringLength(object obj) {
    string str = obj as string;
	return str.Length;
  }
}
```

And the corrected code:
``` cs
class GoodExample {
  public int GetStringLength(object obj) {
    string str = obj as string;
	if (str == null) {
		return -1;
	}
	return str.Length;
  }
}
```

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
