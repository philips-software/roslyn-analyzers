## Introduction

Fields look like _foo. Locals look like foo. (This analyzer does not respect IntelliSense settings in the .editorconfig. It assumes this is your naming convention.)

Variables named exactly `_` (a single underscore) are not allowed as they can be confused with discards.

## How to solve

Rename fields to start with an underscore.
Rename variables that are exactly `_` to a meaningful name.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
class BadExample
{
    private int number;
    
    private void ProcessData()
    {
        byte[] _ = ExtractData(reader);  // Variable named exactly "_"
    }
}

```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
class GoodExample
{
    private int _number;
    
    private void ProcessData()
    {
        byte[] data = ExtractData(reader);  // Use a meaningful name
    }
}

```

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
