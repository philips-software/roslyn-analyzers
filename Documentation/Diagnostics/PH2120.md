## Introduction

Be clear about the possible behaviors of your code to its users, including bad weather scenarios. This includes documenting the complete list of thrown exceptions that might occur.

Please note that this Analyzer reports the exceptions are thrown inside this method, while [PH2124](./PH2124.md) inspects the called methods.

## How to solve

Any exception that is thrown in your method should be mentioned in the method's XML documentation. There is a special [exception](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-tags#exception) element for this. Use this element to describe the conditions in which this exception can occur.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
public class BadExample {
  /// <summary>Some description</summary>
  public void BadCode() {
    throw new ArgumentException();
  }
}
```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
public class GoodExample {
  /// <summary>Some description</summary>
  /// <exception cref="ArgumentException">The condition in which this exception can occur</exception>
  public void GoodCode() {
    throw new ArgumentException();
  }
}
```

## Configuration

This analyzer does not offer any special configuration. The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
