# PH2102: Documentation text should add value

| Property | Value  |

| Package | [Philips.CodeAnalysis.MaintainabilityAnalyzers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Philips.CodeAnalysis.MaintainabilityAnalyzers) |
| Diagnostic ID | PH2102 |
| Category  | [Documentation](../Documentation.md) |
| Analyzer | [XmlDocumentationShouldAddValueAnalyzer](https://github.com/philips-software/roslyn-analyzers/blob/main/Philips.CodeAnalysis.MaintainabilityAnalyzers/Documentation/XmlDocumentationShouldAddValueAnalyzer.cs)
| CodeFix  | Yes |
| Severity | Error |
| Enabled By Default | Yes |

## Introduction

This analyzer attempts to check if the text of the XML code documentation has useful content. Without useful content, it's not adding value. 

In the context of this analyzer, the following case-insensitive words are considered useless:
* get
* set
* the
* a
* an
* it
* I
* of
* to
* for
* on
* or
* and
* value
* indicate
* indicating
* instance
* raise
* raising
* fire
* event
* constructor
* ctor

The name of the node itself is also considered useless.

Trailing 's's are accounted for.

## How to solve

If the purpose of the related code is obvious, remove the XML comments. This is what the CodeFixer does. If the code would benefit from documentation, provide it.

Note: Creating useful comments for every member can be a large effort and if you named your members correctly, their name specifies the purpose already. In these cases XML documentation might not add anything. This viewpoint can cause interference with [CS1591](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs1591), consider disabling it.

## Example

Code that triggers 2 diagnostics:
``` cs
	/// <summary>
	/// The LogFilters
	/// </summary>
	[Flags]
	public enum LogFilters
	{
		/// <summary>
		/// None
		/// </summary>
		None = 0x00,
		/// <summary>
		/// Indicates that verbose entries should be logged.
		/// </summary>
		Verbose = 0x01,
		Information = 0x02,
		Warning = 0x04,
		Error = 0x08,
		Default = Information | Error | Warning,
		All = Information | Error | Warning | Verbose
	}
```

And the corrected code:
``` cs
	[Flags]
	public enum LogFilters
	{
		/// <summary>
		/// If used in isolation, indicates that entries should not be logged.
		/// </summary>
		None = 0x00,
		/// <summary>
		/// Indicates that verbose entries should be logged.
		/// </summary>
		Verbose = 0x01,
		Information = 0x02,
		Warning = 0x04,
		Error = 0x08,
		Default = Information | Error | Warning,
		All = Information | Error | Warning | Verbose
	}
```

## Configuration

Additional useless words can be configured via a comma-separated list in the .editorconfig file using the following syntax:
`dotnet_code_quality.PH2102.additional_useless_words = my,additional,useless,words`

As you come across additional useless XML summary content, consider [filing an Issue](https://github.com/philips-software/roslyn-analyzers/issues/new) or submitting a PR to include the words in the default set.

The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
