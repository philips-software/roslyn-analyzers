## Introduction

Static classes complicate Unit Testing. This rule supports a whitelist, one class per line, in a file named `StaticClasses.Allowed.txt` in the project marked as an &lt;AdditionalFile&gt;.

## How to solve

Migrate into a instance class or singleton.

## Example

Code that triggers a diagnostic:
``` cs
static class BadExample
{
}

```

And the replacement code:
``` cs
class GoodExample
{
}

```

## Configuration

This rule supports a whitelist, one class per line, in a file named `StaticClasses.Allowed.txt` in the project marked as an &lt;AdditionalFile&gt;.

The general ways of [suppressing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/suppress-warnings) diagnostics apply.
