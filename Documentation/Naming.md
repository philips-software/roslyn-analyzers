# Naming

The naming category of diagnostics suggests ways to improve naming of various items, or to make naming more consistent. Examples include:
* Consistent naming of namespaces
* Aligning naming of namespace, files, and projects

There are a couple analyzers for naming of types; however, these are generally falling out of favor as Visual Studio now does a great job of allowing the specification of naming via the .editorconfig file.
